# WebGLCustomTemplate_U3D
Unity3D WebGL custom responsive template with improved progress bar and build's auto-unzipper

**Unity 2017.1 and newer!**

Created new template with almost same functionality (Unity 2017 doesn't expose loading stage other than loading/download percentage) based on Unity 2017.1 template. It might work on Unity 5.6 as well.

For progress bar, to work correctly, you should disable output build compression or unzip *.unityweb files (for Unity 5.5, I have script to do that);
